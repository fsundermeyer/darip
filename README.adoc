Usage:
  darip [OPTIONS] [TRACKS]

See the list of option below.

The list of tracks is to be provided as a comma-separated list, ranges are
supported (e.g. "1,2,5-9,15"). If no tracks are specified, all tracks from
the selected title will be ripped.

General Options:


  --help                  Print this help screen.

  --outdir=PATH           Path to the output directory. If one or more of
                          artist, albumtitle, and year are specified, the
                          output will go to OUTDIR/ARTIST/YEAR_ALBUM
                          Default: $HOME/Music

  --purge=CHARACTER_LIST  Space-separated list of characters that will be
                          removed from file and directory names. |\:*?
                          plus spaces and periods at the beginning and
                          the end of names will always be removed. With this
                          parameter you can specify _additional_ characters
                          that should be replaced.
                          Default: Empty

  --stripspace=(0|1)      Specify whether you want to replace spaces in
                          file or directory names with underscores (1) or
                          not (0).
                          Default: 1 (spaces will be replaced)

  --preset=(medium|       VBR Lame preset. Refer to man lame for more
            standard|     information.
            extreme|      Default: insane
            insane)


Tagging Options:


  --album="ALBUMTITLE",   If one or more of the following options is set,
  --artist="ARTIST",      the mp3 files will automatically be tagged with the
  --comment="COMMENT",    specified data. Album, artist and year will also
  --genre="GENRE",        be used for the output directory (see --outdir).
  --year="YEAR"           Default: unset

  --gain=(album|track)    Apply album or track gain to the mp3 files.
                          Requires mp3gain to be installed.
                          Default: unset (no gain will be applied)

Track titles and numbers will not be written. DVDs usually contain additional
tracks at the beginning or end of the tracklist (e.g. background music for the
menu and/or the credits), which you probably want to remove in a
post-processing step. Titles and track numbers would very likely be wrong in
this case.

Expert Options:


  --device                DVD device.
                          Default: /dev/sr0

  --seeksize              By default the first 10 MB of the DVD files are
                          scanned to detect all subtitles and audio tracks.
                          This should usually be sufficient. If not all tracks
                          are found on you DVD, increase this value.
                          Default: 10

  --title                 Select a DVD title from which the tracks should be
                          ripped. Only specify this option if you are sure
                          which title to us. If you do not specify it, you can
                          choose from the list of available titles.
